# STRIKING ON GOLD

==> Have your strategy around TP (Target Price) or TT (Target Time)

- Check for Vol and Open Interest whether it is growing or increasing

# -----------------------------

# Analysed strategy of cheap options (If expiry >= 6 months buy easy)

- Buy cheap PUTs cause give the underlying stock have reached ATH and when the options expiry is more than a year away and are trending lower the expecatations is that that stock will go up in the time frame but with patience the stock trades sidwways for a while and when it's closer to expiry the options can be worth heaps of money
- Best part is you can buy them whenever and for as little as $200 to make $5k

Cheap calls on the other hand

- You have to wait for massive sell offs and check if anything has been bought for longer time frame

No savings at 30? Here's my 3-step plan for $2,000 of passive income per month (Motley Fool)

# PUTS

For pull backs after massive highs TP max $2 downwards or last middle point
3 to 6 months

# CALLS

Rock bottom to high
6 months to a year - take the fib level and get the first or second range (Max 5 TP)

- second level top
